# AutoMiner
AutoMiner makes it possible for players to create their own miner and let it run for a desired amount of time. The drops of all blocks mined by the AutoMiner will be stored in a chest.

## How to use AutoMiner
You can create a horizontal or a vertical mine.

### Horizontal miner
Just point at a side of a block close to you and use the command `/am on <length in seconds>`. This will start the horizontal mining process and place two storage chests close to the miner origin.

### Vertical Miner
Just point at the top of a block close to you and use the command `/am on <length in seconds>`. This will start the horizontal mining process and place two storage chests close to the miner origin.
